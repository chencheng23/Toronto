Location data analysis on Toronto neighborhoods
Part 1 (Toronto_postcode_clustering) deals with getting neighborhood data from Wikipedia and venue data from Foursquare and clustering Toronto neighborhoods based on frequency of venue types.
Part 2 (Toronto_neighborhood_new_biz_rec) uses a user-based collaborative filtering system to recommend venue types to neighborhoods with few existing venues.
